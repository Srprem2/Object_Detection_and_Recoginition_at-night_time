Object Detection and Recognition under Night Vision

This GitHub repository houses a sophisticated object detection and recognition system designed explicitly for low-light conditions, ensuring reliable performance even in challenging nocturnal environments. Leveraging the robust capabilities of deep learning frameworks, particularly TensorFlow and Keras, this project is centered around a fine-tuned MobileNetV2-based model. Trained to discern eleven distinct classes, including bicycles, cars, and people, the model is optimized for accurate detection in situations where lighting is a constraint.

Key Features:

MobileNetV2 Architecture: The underlying model architecture is based on MobileNetV2, chosen for its efficiency and suitability for real-time applications.
Faster R-CNN Integration: The system incorporates a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, enabling precise localization of detected objects through bounding box predictions.
Video Stream Integration: Beyond image processing, the system seamlessly integrates with video streams using OpenCV. This facilitates frame-by-frame analysis, making it suitable for dynamic environments and surveillance applications.
Application Scenarios:

Security Systems: Enhanced object detection in low-light conditions is crucial for robust security systems, providing reliable surveillance during nighttime.
Monitoring Environments: The system finds applications in monitoring wildlife, outdoor areas, or critical infrastructures during nighttime hours.
Real-time Video Processing: With video stream integration, the project offers real-time object detection capabilities, making it adaptable to diverse scenarios.
